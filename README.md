# play-slam
A game of cards I played with my daughter's. We are making this game and therefore we are making the rules the same as we played then.

```
Starting deck 1234567890JQK1234567890JQK1234567890JQK1234567890JQK // dropping soots

list all posablie moves:
  table:
  12345 //drop inner moves
  aA|Bb
  67890 //drop inner moves
  
Moves to concider

1A,1B,2A,2B,3A,3B,4A,4B,5A,5B,6A,6B,7A,7B,8A,8B,9A,9B,0A,0B

Moves posib - normally two or three moves like:
["1A","3A","8B"]

Now we can just send 1,2 or 3

so the game state can be sent with:
3940J54QJ8642725Q0QJ4838300167KJ715969289KQ316K15K27111311342...
